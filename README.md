# newcastle-bst: Harvard referencing style as recommended by Newcastle University

This package provides a [BibTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/BibTeX) style to format reference lists in the [Harvard at Newcastle](https://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/managing/harvard) style recommended by Newcastle University. It should be used alongside [natbib](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) for citations.

## Installation
The required style file is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX) and [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/newcastle-bst). You can use the style by copying it into your working directory containing your `.tex` file. You can also add it to your bst directory in your tex path to use it without having to copy it over each time.

## Using the style
To use the style include this in your preamble:
```tex
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage[UKenglish]{isodate}
\bibliographystyle{newcastle}
```

Also remember to specify your `.bib` file at the end of the document:
```tex
\bibliography{file}
```

The easiest way to create .bib files for this style is through exporting entries from a reference manager such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/).
However, some parts are not available through this (such as titleaddon for computer programs).
If you notice any discrepancies between generated references and the recommended styles then please raise this on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX/issues)
